                        <p>
                            A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.[2][3][4] The Indian style, often accompanied by a chutney, is probably the most widely known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to China, which have origins in medieval times or earlier.[2] Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Western Asia, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa. Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas, samosas today are often prepared in other regions.The samosa originated in the Middle East and Central Asia.[9] It then spread to Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and elsewhere. The term samosa and its variants cover a family of pastries and dumplings popular from north-eastern Africa to western China. The samosa spread to the Indian subcontinent, following the invasion of the Central Asian Turkic dynasties in the region.[10] A praise of samosa (as sanbusaj) can be found in a 9th-century poem by the Persian poet Ishaq al-Mawsili. Recipes for the dish are found in 10th–13th-century Arab cookery books, under the names sanbusak, sanbusaq, and sanbusaj, all of which derive from the Persian word sanbosag. In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century, its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the sambusas of Larestan).[2] Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995-1077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, Tarikh-e Beyhaghi.[

                        <p>
                           A patty is a flattened, usually round, serving of ground meat or meat alternatives. The meat is compacted and shaped, cooked, and served.

Patties can be eaten with a knife and fork in dishes like Salisbury steak, but are typically served in a sort of sandwich called a "burger", or a hamburger if the patty is made from ground beef.

The term "patty" is used in many varieties of English, but less frequently in the Britain and Ireland than in the United States.[1]

Similar-shaped meat cakes not made from ground beef may also be called "burger": "turkey burgers" or "fishburgers" may be made from reshaped mechanically separated meat. Sometimes burgers are breaded. Veggie burger patties are made without meat, usually of soy, but also often of other beans and occasionally of other mixed vegetables.[2]

In Ireland, traditional chippers often serve batter burger (a beef-based patty dipped in batter and deep fried) or spice burger (a savory patty made with a proprietary recipe of meats and spices).[3] These are served in a greaseproof paper bag and eaten with the hands.

In India, a patty may also be vegetarian.

                        <p>
                            It consists of a round or ball-shaped, hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp crepe), filled with a mixture of flavored water (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion or chickpeas.
                            Panipuri's name varies depending on the region. In Haryana it is known as paani patashi; in Madhya Pradesh fulki; in Uttar Pradesh pani ke batashe/padake ; in Assam phuska/puska and pakodi; in parts of Gujarat, Gup-chup in parts of Odisha, Phuchka in Bihar, Nepal, Jharkhand, Bengal and Chhattisgarh.[4] It is also very popular in Delhi.

Phuchka (or fuska or puska) differs from panipuri in content and taste. It uses a mixture of boiled gram and spiced mashed potatoes as the filling,[4] and is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and spicy.
