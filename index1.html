                    <li>
              Chhole Samosa<br>
Chhole is an important component of street food across India. After being combined with bhature, puri and kachori, it has now found its way with samosa too. Cooked with aromatic spices and seasoning, the soft filling with the crunchy exterior sure tastes good.
 <li>
Jam Samosa<br>

As weird as it sounds, jam samosa has the potential for becoming your next favourite type of samosa. Golden brown crispy outing with jam oozing out with every bite sounds good as a dessert as well for an evening snack.
 <li>
Chinese Samosa<br>

Containing chowmein, noodles or even plain Maggi, this samosa is a delight for all those who love Chinese food. You can experiment with the different types of noodles you want to fill in. Although it sounds a bit peculiar, the resulting taste can be wonderful.
 <li>
Fish Samosa<br>

For those who love fish and want to constantly come up with new ways to have it all the time, this one is the perfect snack. Made with poached fish, herbs, seasoning and a bit of mashed potato, fish samosa is a hit.
 <li>
Pasta Samosa<br>

For those who love Italian as well as Indian cuisine, this one is a crossbreed giving them the best of both the worlds. Make your favourite kind of pasta, keeping in mind to make it dense enough to stay in the samosa properly, fill it, fry it and you're good to go. 
 <li>
Punjabi Samosa<br>

Punjabi samosa, available mainly in the North, is an elaborate delicacy made with cinnamon, full black peppercorns, cloves, green cardamom, a little bit of cumin, fennel seeds, coriander seeds and dry pomegranate seeds. Yes, it is as delicious as it sounds.
 <li>
Keema Samosa<br>

Keema samosa is prevalent in areas which serve non-veg street food. It is also widely consumed during the holy month of Ramadan. Best in taste when consumed with ketchup, it is a really delectable snack for all you 'pure non-vegetarians'.
 <li>
Cauliflower Samosa<br>

Cauliflower samosa, also known as Phulkapir Singara, is well known throughout Bengal and available in all shops there. The filling is hot, fiery and tangy, ideal for those who love their snack spicy. Serve with a side of ketchup and tamarind chutney.
 <li>
Cheese Samosa<br>

It is very difficult to say no to cheese. As you slowly tear apart the hot crispy covering, the cheese will come oozing out. The cheese filling can be combined with corn, onion, coriander, chilli flakes or anything else to suit your preferences.
 <li>
Mushroom Samosa<br>

It sounds absurd but is actually a great filling. Mushrooms provide a soft texture and consistency that makes it a scrumptious delicacy. The ingredients usually used are white button mushrooms, onion, tomato, green chilli, garlic cloves, ginger and coriander leaves.
 <li>
Chocolate Samosa<br>

While it may sound ridiculous to some and absolutely toothsome to others, no one can deny that it is very appealing. It is also loved by kids. You can fill in crunchy chocolates or even plain Nutella, it will be yummy either way. 
 <li>
Onion Samosa<br>

Onion samosa is almost as popular as the classic samosa and is available everywhere. For those who don't like potato or are fat conscious, this is an option as it is as palatable as the other variants, sometimes even more so.
 <li>
Sweet Samosa<br>

What is also known as Khoya samosa, this one works as a sweet as well as a snack. It contains a filling of khoya or coconut milk along with dry fruits and nuts. It is heavy, lip-smacking and one of the favourite desserts at sweet shops as well as celebrations.
 <li>
Carrot Samosa<br>

Serving as another alternative to the classic samosa, it is made with carrots, green peas, amchur powder, turmeric powder, mint/pudina and green chilly. This is one snack which can be called tasty as well as relatively healthy.
 <li>
Egg Samosa<br>

Eggs are fantastic because of the many ways they can be cooked and eaten. Another one added to that list is egg samosa. It tastes heavenly. Scramble the eggs, make a seasoned bhurji or even stuff it with boiled egg pieces if you want, it will be succulent as ever.
 <li>
Chicken Samosa<br>

Chicken samosa needs no introduction. Almost as popular as the classic samosa in the non-vegetarian crowd, it is also as tasty. Shredded chicken pieces or chicken gravy, however, you make the filling, taste is guaranteed!
 <li>
Paneer Samosa<br>

Paneer samosa is mouthwatering. Soft crumbled paneer with coriander, seasoning and assorted herbs filled in a crunchy samosa Patti and served with ketchup and green chutney; aren't you already drooling?
